# About Mr. Dlib (from the website)

Mr. DLib is a non-profit open-source project to provide recommendations-as-a-service for research articles, call for papers, and academic news. Mr. DLib was originally developed as a Machine-readable Digital Library at the [University of California, Berkeley](http://www.berkeley.edu/) and is nowadays run by researchers, among others, from the [Trinity College Dublin](http://www.tcd.ie/) (Ireland), and the [University of Konstanz](https://www.uni-konstanz.de/en/) (Germany).

# Note about Source Code (2019-08-15)

The source code in this repository is not maintained any more. We have re-developed a new recommendations-as-a-serivce technology named "Darwin & Goliath" https://www.scss.tcd.ie/joeran.beel/blog/2019/08/03/darwin-goliath-a-white-label-recommender-system-as-a-service-with-automated-algorithm-selection/. 

That technology is no used for Mr. DLib, but it is not open source. If you are interested in a collaboration, please contact us.
